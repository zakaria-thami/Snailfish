# Snailfish
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue)  
Snailfish numbers arenâ€™t like regular numbers. Instead, every snailfish number is a pair - an ordered list of two elements. Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

----------
## assignment - 1 
Add up all of the snailfish numbers from the homework assignment in the order they appear. What is the magnitude of the final sum?

## assignment - 2

You notice a second question on the back of the homework assignment:

What is the largest magnitude you can get from adding only two of the snailfish numbers?

Note that snailfish addition is not commutative - that is, x + y and y + x can produce different results.

## Development Steps in Abstract 
  - step one: read inputs
  - step two: classe design (snailfish)
  - step three: parse from string to list snalfish numbers
  - step four: code commenting
  - step five: output cleaning
